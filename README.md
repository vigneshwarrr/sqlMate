# sqlMate

Thought of starting this project to make an assistant tool that will help build queries in a complicated business RDBMS table design situation.

o	Reads DB table schemas, understand relations between tables and helps build complex select queries.
o	Lets the DBA define business case relationship between table columns, which may not be defined by constraints
o	Gives auto ‘Join’ column suggestion for columns that are not present in current table but needed.
o	Uses a range of pre built functions to build commonly needed complex business queries.
